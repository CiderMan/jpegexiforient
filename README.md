jpegexiforient
==============

jpegexiforient is a tool that allows querying and setting of the orientation field in JPEG EXIF data. It comes from <a href="http://jpegclub.org//">JPEGclub.org</a>, details of <a href="http://jpegclub.org//exif_orientation.html">how and why you use it</a> are available there and the original source code (which should match what is checked in here) can also be <a href="http://jpegclub.org//jpegexiforient.c">downloaded from there</a>.

The reason for making a copy here is that, while it is often included with the jpegtran package in Linux distributions, I was not easily able to find a Windows executable and I want to use this executable in a cross-platofrm application (https://github.com/CiderMan/PGTips). This project is solely intended to provide Windows "releases" of jpegexiforient.
